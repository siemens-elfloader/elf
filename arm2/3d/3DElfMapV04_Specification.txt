h20 - start Objects Info Block
	1byte - object type (texture, sprite, etc)
	1byte - number of bytes used for object name (n)
	n bytes - object name (not absolute name)
	1byte - object misc byte (indicates how many next bytes will be used for other params. usually it's zero. for compatable beetwen maps and engines versions>=04)
if Object type are 0x04:	4 bytes used for speed of NPC's movement
				1 bytes indicates type of movement

h?? - worldMap bytes (mapWidth * mapHeight matrix)


Object types:
0x01 - texture
0x02 - sprite
0x03 - map for changing
0x04 - NPC

Speed of NPC's movement may be 1 or 2
Types of NPC's movement:
0x01 - patroling near walls
0x?? - random move
