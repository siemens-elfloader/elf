0621 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. The full function chip, can be used as FuncLimited chip.
            2. When chip is FuncLimited, delete AC3-pin in WaveCyclicSB16.
            3. When use 44k rendering for SPDIFOUT, we must receive a 2 channels
               format from system, because the Sensaura library can't support
               channel mixing st this time. (if we un-check Reverb, and use MCI
               to play sound, the sound will be missing).

0620 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. After Sensaura rendering, multiply a coefficient 1.2 to increase
               the signal level for HCT test of Sensaura WDM driver.
            2. only Sensaura INF exists (HCTINF is cancelled).

STEP2.SYS : 1. In INF file, use "CutMSSpeakerConfig" to disconnect the speaker
               config from Microsoft control panel.

STEP3.SYS : 1. When judging FuncLimited, chip 055 is inversed.
            2. When chip is FuncLimited, ValidateFormat will fail the format,
               KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_DOLBY_AC3_SPDIF.

0619 (Sensaura Library 2135)
STEP1.SYS : 1. PC Speaker mute
            2. Microphone recording gain control (Boost when recording)
            3. When playing a 6 channel wave during recording is active,
               inform Sensaura and switch to 4 speakers.
            4. In KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_MISCELLANEOUS property, add an item called,
               EnableSensaura, to save ADAPTER_USE_SENSAURA in registry.

STEP2.SYS : 1. In KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_SPDIF property, add an item called,
               SamplingRate, to select rendering SPDIF on 44k or 48k
            2. fix speaker geometry
            3. fix Microphone recording gain control (stored in HWMixerExtSettings)

STEP3.SYS : 1. fix the bug of "When recording is active, switch to 4 speakers"


0618 (Sensaura Library 2135)
1. Use multiplex node and sum node to select recording source in topology.
   User can choose multiple sources in MS recording control
   (traditional 8738 way).
2. fix the problem that 037 chip 18H D24 cannot read correctly

0617 (Sensaura Library 2135)
1. Use multiplex node to select recording source in topology
2. "RecordMultiplex" in INF is used as the default selection (1-5)
   RecordMultiplex = 1 ---> Wave
   RecordMultiplex = 2 ---> Line In
   RecordMultiplex = 3 ---> Aux
   RecordMultiplex = 4 ---> CD
   RecordMultiplex = 5 ---> Microphone
   RecordMultiplex = 6 ---> All (Wave + LineIn + Aux + CD + Mic)
3. KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_CHIP_INFO can get CMI33, CMI37, CMI39, CMI55
4. RecordMultiplex = 6 ---> decided by RecordSettings
5. Add the following property, which is used to determine the
   private combined record-settings.
   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_RECORD_SELECT = 9;

0616 (Sensaura Library 2135)
1. Solve the problem of MCI FALSE-Multi-Channel.
   Use "Enable-Reverb" to control MCI 2 or 6 channels
2. Add the following properties
   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_CHIP_INFO = 6;
   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_CHANNEL_NUM = 7;
   KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_PLAY_6CHAN = 8;
3. Note that KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_PLAY_6CHAN can over-write
   "Enable-Reverb" in KSPROPERTY_CMAUDIO_GLOBAL_REVERB
4. Disable ForceGenerateCenter/ForceCopyMode in property page

0615 (Sensaura Library 2135)
1. Add a registry key, MasterVolAtten, which can cantrol the master volume
   Attenuation.
   MasterVolAtten's unit = dB, ex., 0x0001 = 1dB, 0x0002 = 2dB
2. Add 055 chip version judgement (by John)
3. 1. Mute LineIn, Aux, CD, and Mic, when volume level is 0
   2. fix the bugs of reported maximum channels (=6, not 4),
      but 033, 037, 039_As_037 the SpeakerConfig is limited to 4

0614 (Sensaura Library 2135)
1. fix the bugs of speaker settings, the sound channels heard is coincident
   with the speaker settings in mixer.exe now. The speaker settings of direct
   sound is Microsoft's problem. It has no solution for the present.

0613 (Sensaura Library 2135)
1. Sensaura update channels.cpp, common.cpp, mintopo.cpp, shared.h,
   (in, ConvertLogToLin(int vol, int pan), a second augument is added)

0612 (Sensaura Library 2135)
1. Sensaura library updated (fixed bugs on "Soldier of Fortune", "Unreal Tournement")
2. Force central generation on 6-channel
3. fix the bug of "AdapterCommon->QueryCapability return wrong BOOLEAN state"
4. fix the bug of "the set method of PropertyHandler_Miscellaneous always return FALSE"
5. Microphone gain control

1. some modifications from SENSAURA

0609 (Sensaura Library 2133)

2. enable h/w bass as 5-channel activate

0608 (Sensaura Library 2133)
1. add front left/right volume control to private mixer
2. optimise dma channel management (intermediate version)
3. optimise dma channel management
4. add chip capability query support (full function or LX/MX)
