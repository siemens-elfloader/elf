<p align=right>Thanks for this translation to dspmobile and <a href="http://translate.ru">www.translate.ru</a> ;)</p>

<p align=justify>This program is intended for exploring the fullflash of a Siemens phone. It pulls out from fullflash the information on Menu, EEprom, Langpack, Pictures and RingTones and then shows them in a convenient way. The program has been developed for x55 series, but, on idea, should work competently and with the fullflash of other Siemens phones. It is initially intended for flash patching, but it can be also useful to unsophisticated users. We shall stop more in detail on items of the menu of the program.

<H2 align=center>Information</H2>
<p align=justify>In this Text field, every possible information which the program managed to pull out from FF (FullFlash) is shown. While the program goes through each section all found information is added in this field again and again.

<H2 align=center>EEPROM</H2>
<p align=justify>Oh, those eeprom blocks ! It all began with them (SiemPROM). In this list the following columns are shown: the Block number, the Description, the Version, the Offset of the block in FF, the Size, an attribute of presence of some additional information (*) and an attribute of removal of the block (-). The additional information is available for the following blocks in EEPROM:
<UL>
<li>5079 - User dictionary T9
<li>5076 - the Greeting
<li>5124 - Groups
<li>5098-5104 - WAP-bookmarks
<li>5170-5179 - Notes
<li>5166 - the Alarm clock
<li>280 - the Engineering menu (only for x55)
<li>5206 - List SMS. This block is not present on S55, M55
<li>71 - the Profile of factory adjustments
<li>5209 - the User phrases
<li>5168 - my BT-identification
<li>5262 - Known BT-devices
<li>5136 - Timeout Java-connections (S55, M55, SL55)
<li>5237-5241 - Timeout Java-connections (C55)
<li>5274 - the Current color scheme
<li>5275-5278 - Color schemes 1 - 4
<li>67 – Parameters of accumulator
</UL>
We shall stop more in detail on some blocks:
<p align=justify><b>TimeOut Java-connections</b>. If you use Java-GPRS applications such as ICQ for phone (for example uMessanger) and if you stop using the phone (do not press a button for certain time) – a timeout occurs and switching-off from GPRS. You can increase the timeout in this operation by modifying this block. Simply apply with the help of V_Klay the patch which will be offered to you by the program. Works on C55, S55, M55, SL55.
<p align=justify>These and many other functions (as well as in all other lists) are accessible with the right click of the mouse. Blocks can be loaded / unloaded on disk either one by one, or all together. During this operation work is done in a sub-directory \EEPROM just below the directory where FF (FullFlash) resides. The Check on " Show deleted blocks " influences, whether the removed blocks will be displayed in the list. Sometimes it is useful to search for the old blocks, recoil to which in some cases can help if phone began works bad. Items of the emerging menu which lead to change of windows "Information" and "Patch", are allocated by a tic.

<H2 align=center>Langpack</H2>
<p align=justify>Here all is simple: Langpack - it is language pack. In this list the language messages found by the program in FF, with the language number, message number and offset in FF are shown. In a menu accessible with right click, it is possible to be switched to desirable language or to choose to display of all languages. Under fictitious language 99 the text lines laying outside of Langpack.
<p align=justify>For editing whole langpack:
<ol>
<li>Open list “Langpack”
<li>Langpack – Save langpack’s area. You should rename this file. It’s our backup.
<li>Langpack – Save langpack.
<li>Edit this file by help MS Word or another unicode-editor
<li>Langpack – Load langpack.
<li>If was message “Langpack’s size exceeded” – goto 4. If all Ok – goto window “Info” and check cutted messages. If this messages not important you can ignore theirs cutting.
<li>Langpack – Save Langpack area.
<li>Set “Automatic” language in mobile
<li>Open this file in V_Klay – Flasher. Address and size should be setted automatically.
<li>Upload this file to mobile. Enjoy.
<li>If smth wrong – restore your mobile from backup (point 2).
</ol>
<p align=justify>- Smelter compress langpack worse than Siemens on ~ 10%.<BR>
- On x65 exact size of langpack must be less than FF240 = 1045056 bytes

<H2 align=center>Menu</H2>
<p align=justify>In this a list of the Menu items found by the program in FF will be displayed. Of greater interest are the contents of the column "Entry". In it, it is possible to see the entry - points necessary for patches that change the functionality of the soft keys of the phone. For example, we admit, we have such patch:
<PRE>
; S55v20 - Change of function " the Arrow to the Left "
32499C: DA7106B8 DA74240C; Explorer
</PRE>
What happens with that? The call of the function by default assigned on the Left Arrow (GPRS-Info), is replaced with a call of function "Explorer". But what happens if we do not want Explorer, and, for example, we want the Dictaphone? For this purpose it is necessary to learn the entry point of another element the Dictaphone. On S55v20, it is in the menu 14.6, the entry–point is equal 67AF82. Having reversed the places of the last 2 bytes and having added in front DA we shall end with the following patch:
<PRE>
; S55v20 - Change of function " the Arrow to the Left "
32499C: DA7106B8 DA6782AF; Dictaphone
</PRE>
It is simple, isn’t that so? Language of the names of the menu elements varies simultaneously with work in Langpack section. Therefore, in order that items to be referred not as String #000, but in human form - simply open Langpack item, choose with right click the desirable language and return back in Menu for viewing.
<p align=justify>In the Menu list, as well as in all others, by using right clicks on the list some useful functions are accessible. The columns Handle and Items specify the beginning of the heading of the menu and the table of elements, accordingly, and are of interest only for advanced flash patching. The same columns for elements of a submenu contain the ID numbers of the menu labels ( as messages ) in LangPack for the usual and the larger font case ( Big letters ).

<H2 align=center>Pictures</H2>
<p align=justify>In this list all pictures inside FF are shown. Contents of columns: number of PIT-table, number of picture in current PIT-table, total number of picture, the pixel size on X, the pixel size on Y, color bits on pixel, the address of a picture, its size, decompressed size and the address of the description row of the picture. The decompressed size specifies how many bytes would be the picture, if it was not compressed, and it is shown, accordingly, only for the compressed pictures. Loading of pictures in FF from a disk is not possible, and the unloading occurs in directory \BMP under the directory of the fullflash. In the right top corner it is possible to see the picture and its brief characteristics. The option " To show a picture " saves it on disk and the graphic editor registered in system starts for showing it.

<H2 align=center>RingTones</H2>
<p align=justify>Contents of columns of this list: number of a melody, quantity of notes (for polyphony - type), time of sounding in seconds, type of a melody, offset, size, the address of the description row of a ringtone and, actually, a melody. Text representation of a melody is a set of the notes divided by a blank. Each note is described as frequency : duration, in Hz and ms, accordingly. Ringtones are correctly reproduced only under Win2000 and WinXP. Under 98 and Me theoretically speaker should beep muffledly somehow simply. I do not know, did not check. For listening melodies it is necessary to include "Auto Play" with the help of the right button of the mouse and to move under the list. Or to switch off "Auto Play" and to listen to each melody individually. The loading / unloading of melodies occurs in the directory \MIDI under the directory of fullflash. Monophonic it is kept in a bin-format. For converters from bin to mid the Internet is full. All melodies are shown, except for melodies of type 01 as I do not know yet how to decipher it. Polyphony (wav, mid) is reproduced as follows: the melody is saved on a disk and standard means of system for reproduction of such files is started. Monophonic it is reproduced through system speaker.

<H2 align=center>Files</H2>
<p align=justify>In this list you can see content of flex-memory of your mobile (filesystem)

<H2 align=center>Patch</H2>
<p align=justify>Any changes in FF are accumulated in this field. After you have stopped investigating the FF go there and either save a patch, or with the help " Tools - V_Klay " start patcher. About the presence of the data for a patch speaks the indicator in last field of the status line.

<H2 align=center>Address book</H2>
<p align=justify>Function “Tools – Address book” will help to recover information from file 5F0x.adr

<H2 align=center>Multilanguage support</H2>
<p align=justify>The Program has flexible Multilanguage interface. The Language files for program lies <a href="http://avkiev.kiev.ua/Siemens/Smelter/Smelter_lng.rar">here</a>. If you want to add your language in program - download the language files and upon their image and resemblance create the file of your language. Hereon translate one of the files to documentation Smelter_xx.htm on your language and together with language file send me. During editing the lines of the language file do not lose initial and final gaps. Emphases follows to turn on the following lines:
<UL>
<li>x100 - description You as translator
<li>x101 - Your coordinates
<li>x102 - Your coordinates
<li>x103 - name of Your file-documentation
<li>x104 - link on forum, where is discussed Smelter on Your language
<li>x105 - name of Your language in format Language Editor with all tags.
</UL>
If you have noticed the inexactnesses of the translation in already existing languages - download the language files, edit necessary and send me.

<H2 align=center>Tools - Midlet Signer</H2>
This function very similar to <b>MidletSigner2</b> from <b>Chaos</b>, but doesn't use Java.<BR>
Creating your own certificate:
<ol>
<li>You need Windows 2000 or higher
<li>Set in mobile and computer real date/time
<li>Copy from mobile file <b>Config\Policy\manufacturer.sbp</b> to computer. You can omit this step, in this case file will be created automatically.
<li>Tools - Midlet Signer - Create certificate
<li>Enter the name of certificate (for example - your name)
<li>Enter the path to file <b>Config\Policy\manufacturer.sbp</b>
<li>Copy der-file to mobile to folder <b>\Config\Certificate Store</b>
<li>Copy file <b>manufacturer.sbp</b> to mobile to folder <b>\Config\Policy</b> (replace existing)
</ol>
Signing midlets:
<ol>
<li>Set permissions for midlet by help checking/unchecking items in "Tools - Midlet Signer"
<li>Tools - Midlet Signer - Sign midlet
<li>Choose midlet
<li>Choose certificate
<li>Copy midlet to mobile. Enjoy ;)
</ol>
<i>Note from Chaos</i>. Be carefully with midlet's signing. Don't allow unknown midlets all permissions.

<H2 align=center>Some the general remarks</H2>
<UL>
<li>Any list can be unloaded in a text file for the subsequent processing (" Full Flash - Save e list as text")
<li>In any list right click of the mouse opens the contextual menu
<li>In all lists there is a function " To copy offset in the clipboard buffer "
<li>In all lists double-clicking on a line of the list leads to open of the corresponding area in WinHex or HexWorkshop
<li>If in a system HexWorkshop is installed the program tries to open the block in it. If it is not present – then it tries in WinHex
<li>In the lists of Menu, EEPROM, Langpack and Files function Search (Ctrl-F) and his continuation (Ctrl-G) works
<li>The line of the status contains a lot of the useful digital information, read tips
<li>The Program can work with only the EEPROM-area. And it is possible also to work with big FF (16M). Or it is possible to work with only the LangPack
<li>As empty blocks in a window "Information" are understood 64 kilobyte blocks completely filled FF. That is the block 5C for example is the area of memory 5C0000 - 5CFFFF
<li>If the program complains for the absence of any files - take advantage of program <a href="http://avkiev.kiev.ua/Siemens/Soft/OcxCtrl.rar">OCX Ctrl</a>
<li>At loading the information from a disk in FF, the size of the block on a disk should be equal exactly to the size of the corresponding area in FF, otherwise the program will give out a message for error
<li>At mass loading, files, which contents in accuracy it is equal to corresponding area ff, do not lead to occurrence of the additional information in a window "Patch"
<li>If you have any helpful information - you are welcome. My coordinates - at the end of this document
