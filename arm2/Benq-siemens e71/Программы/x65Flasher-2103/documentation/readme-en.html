<blockquote><i>Probably this list is incomplete. If your
phone
is SGold-based, probably flasher will
work with it. Phones on Benq platform are not supported, and their
support is not planned.</i><br>
  <i>With phones of old series (45,55,60) and
A-series, use Freia and V_Klay. If you have some new phone don't know
whether it's on SGold platform, look at its keyboard - in SGold-based
phones a space character is on the
button 1 (although this, certainly, not 100% sign)<br>
  <br>
* EL71 with fw 37 and higher and E71 use new key algorithm. For this
time you can work with these phones only through testpoint.<br>
  </i></blockquote>
<u><b>Choice of a cable</b></u><br>
<blockquote>Flasher can work with a phone only through
a COM-cable or USB-cable with the USB-to-COM converter. A cable that
goes in the package - DCA-540, it is clean USB-cable, flasher doesn't
work
with it. Most Chinese USB-cables work without problems. A simple test:
cable must be recognized by a computer, even if a phone is not
connected. Also in USB-to-COM cables you can see a small box in the
middle of a cable. In the case
of COM-cable, the power must go from the COM-port (you cannot check
this by look).<br>
Original cables DCA-510, DCA-512 does work;
DCA-500, DCA-540 doesn't.<br>
You cannot work with flasher via IRDA or
bluetooth.<br>
</blockquote>
<u><b>About used terms</b></u><br>
<blockquote><i><b>Flash</b></i> - a chip of non-volatile memory. It
contains firmware, bootcore, phone settings, filesystem.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Fullflash </b></i>- a complete copy of flash memory.
It has 32, 64 or 96 Mbytes size depending on the phone model. If you
have fullflash backup, you can always recover your phone after bad
patches or failures during flashing. Therefore fullflash backup is the
first thing you should do before changing&nbsp; anything in the phone.<br>
  <i><b><br>
Bootcore </b></i>- initial loader, the most critical
part of the flash. If bootcore is broken, you have to make testpoint to
recover the phone. For this reason, write to bootcore is disabled by
default; to override this, start
flasher with /B switch.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Firmware </b></i>- the phone's program code.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>EEPROM </b></i>- the individual settings of the phone
(IMEI, boot key, GSM/GPRS settings, battery parameters...) Consists of
two parts - EEFULL and EELITE. It's extremely undesirable to lose
your own EEPROM, although it is possible to recover partially with
PapuaUtils tool.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>FFS </b></i>- phone's file system that is accessible
through MPM and other programs. Consists of three disks: 0: - user
FFS, 1: - cache, 2: - system FFS. Disks 1: and 2: are visible only when
SKEY is entered to phone.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Bootloader </b></i>- the small program that is sent to
phone by flasher when you're pressing the red button. It implements
reading/writing of flash memory. To get your bootloader working, you
need either BOOTKEY or SKEY of this phone.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>SKEY </b></i>- service key of&nbsp; the phone,
8-digit number. After entering the SKEY to the phone, it is
possible to use any bootloader; it also opens developer manu, access to
disks 1: and 2:, access to protected blocks of EEPROM.<br>
  <i><b><br>
BOOTKEY </b></i>- bootloadet authentication key, used
for loading arbitrary bootloader into the phone. Unlike SKEY, it is not
kept in the phone, but sent with bootloader.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>HASH </b></i>- unique 16-byte number. It is used for
verification of the keys. Recorded in the bootcore.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>ESN </b></i>- unique serial number. It
is kept in the one-time programmable region of the flash chip; it's
impossible to change it.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Testpoint </b></i>- a place on the PCB of the phone.
Shorting it to the ground, one will be able to send any bootloader,
without knowing the keys. You have to disassemble your phone to do
this, of course this voids the warranty.<br>
</blockquote>
<u><b>Searching for the boot keys</b></u><br>
<blockquote>To make your phone "visible" to the flasher,
you need to know SKEY or BOOTKEY. There are three methods to find them:<br>
  <br>
1. Using midlet (bsReader or px75v1).<br>
Copy the bsReader midlet to the Applications folder in the phone (for
S75/SL75 and Benq-Siemens phones) or px75v1 to Java\Jam\Applications
(for older models), then launch the midlet from
"Applications" menu. After 5-15 minutes midlet will show HASH and ESN.<br>
Start flasher, choose "Keys" -&gt; "Calculate SKEY and BOOTKEY", enter
description of the phone, HASH and ESN. The calculation of the key
lasts usually up to 10
minutes. The program also generates loader for V_Klay, copy
it to &lt;path_to_VKlay&gt;\data\loaders. Now choose COM-port, speed
and description of your phone, and press "Connect".<br>
If you wish, you can enter SKEY to the phone ("Keys" -&gt; "Enter
SKEY").<br>
  <br>
  <i>About bsReader and px75v1: they use a bug in
java, due to which you can directly read phone's memory. Midlet works
not always stable, sometimes hangs up, sometimes generates Exception,
sometimes turns the phone off. If you had not success first time, try
again. Some day the java bug will be fixed. So, if the midlet generated
the same
Exception all the times, probably it was happen. Use methods 2
and 3.</i><br>
  <br>
2. If you already know SKEY for your phone, choose
"Keys" -&gt; "Enter SKEY". After entering the key, flasher
works with the phone without additional actions.<br>
  <br>
3. If you don't know the key, and midlet doesn't work, the only variant
is testpoint. You can find pictures of the testpoints for many phone
models at
http://allsiemens.com/testpoints. The testpoint have to be shorten to
the ground
through a 10-50 ohm resistor. You can use some metal
thing, but take a big care, because shorting of wrong point on the PCB
can put the phone out of service. Choose the "Testpoint" boot method in
the flasher, press "Connect", then short the testpoint, push the red
button, then release testpoint in 3 seconds. Now you can choose "Keys"
-&gt;
"Calculate SKEY and BOOTKEY" (HASH and ESN has been already read from
the phone).<br>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>To work with phone, choose COM port, speed, boot key of
your phone. A serial port with standard drivers supports up to 115200
kbps, for some motherboards you can achieve higher speeds using
HiSerial driver. USB cables support up to 1600000 kbps, the real speed
depends on quality of the cable.<br>
In the list of boot keys, choose a key calculated for your phone. If
you have entered SKEY into the phone, flasher will work with any boot
key.<br>
You can select "File" instead of real COM-port, in this case flasher
will ask you to open fullflash image, it will work with it as with the
real phone (sometimes it might be useful).<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Backup: </b></i>save an image of the flash or its part into a
file with fbk extension. Flasher asks what do you want to backup -
fullflash, bootcore, firmware, filesystem or EEPROM. You don't have to
calculate address and length or memory region, flasher will do it for
you.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Restore:</b></i> write saved image from fbk file back to the
flash. If you have fullflash image, you can restore only its part (for
example, filesystem). To restore bootcore, start flasher with /B switch.<br>
By default, flasher writes only blocks that have been changed, this
speeds up the restore process in the case of small changes. You can
choose "force write of unchanged blocks" option to override this.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Memory map:</b></i> show the map of flash blocks in graphical
view. You can compare current map of flash with fullflash image,
flasher will mark changed blocks on the map.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Format FFS:</b></i> this command formats disk 0: of the phone.
After formatting, turn the phone on and wait a few minutes - the phone
initializes filesystem.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Change phone model:</b></i> this option can be useful, if you
want to try the firmware from different phone. Use this option with
caution, because it changes bootcore area.<br>
  <br>
  <i><b>Read flash, write flash:</b></i> low-level work with flash. You
have to specify address and length of the block. Keep in mind that
flash memory is split into blocks (64k, 128k, or 256k, depends on flash
chip and not always equal to the size of the block that shown in the
flash map). For writing, address and length should be multiply of&nbsp;
block size, reading can be done with any address and length.<br>
</blockquote>
<u><b>Command line options</b></u><br>
<blockquote><b>/L</b> - show communication log<br>
  <b>/B</b> - enable writing to the bootcore (use
with caution!)<br>
