 *
 * 2. Includes the product configuration header file, DLib_Product.h, that

 *    configuration is valid.
 *
 * 3. Sets up default values for all remaining configuration symbols.
 *
 * This configuration header file, the one defined by _DLIB_CONFIG_FILE, and
 * DLib_Product.h configures how the runtime environment should behave. This
 * includes all system headers and the library itself, i.e. all system headers
 * includes this configuration header file, and the library has been built

 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and
 * contry-specific settings for a number of areas, including currency
 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings is choosen by defining any
 * number of _LOCALE_USE_xxx and _ENCODING_USE_xxx symbols. The application
 * will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is always
 * supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. One preselected locale and one preselected encoding is then used
 * directly. That locale can not be changed during runtime. The preselected
 * locale and encoding is choosen by defining at most one of _LOCALE_USE_xxx
 * and at most one of _ENCODING_USE_xxx. The default is to use the "C" locale
 * and the single byte encoding, respectively.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for the locale interface with the "C"
 * locale and the single byte encoding.

 *
 * Note that if locks are used the following symbols must be defined:
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_MACRO(control_variable, init_function)
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE_INIT
 * They will be used to initialize the needed locks only once. TYPE is the 
 * type for the static control variable, MACRO is the expression that will be
 * evaluated at each usage of a lock, and INIT is the initializer for the
 * control variable.
 *
 * Note that if thread model 3 is used the symbol _DLIB_TLS_POINTER must be 
 * defined. It is a thread local pointer to a dynamic memory area that 
 * contains all used TLS variables for the library. Optionally these two
 * symbols must be defined as well (default is to use the default const data 
 * and data memories):
 *   _DLIB_TLS_INITIALIZER_MEMORY which memory to place the initializers for the
 *                                TLS memory area
 *   _DLIB_TLS_MEMORY             which memory to use for the TLS memory area
