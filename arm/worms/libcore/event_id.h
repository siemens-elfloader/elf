/// its receipt by a handler. Events may be either dynamically or statically
/// defined. A dynamic event is handled in ActionScript: an AS-defined
/// function is called when the event is raised. Dynamic events do not need
/// event_id.
//
/// Event handlers may also be defined statically, for instance in a
/// PlaceObject2 tag, or by default. System events such as mouse handling,
/// load milestones, or keyboard events should be sent to appropriate
/// DisplayObjects. This process uses event_id.

/// Static events may additionally be handled dynamically (using ActionScript).
